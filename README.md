# Billiard

## [View demo](http://mycodetherapy.github.io/billiard)

## This billiard is written using classes and shared context. It was created with the goal of remembering the class approach in React and applying something other than Redux.

### To run locally:

1. `git clone <repo>`
2. `cd <local repo>` and `npm install`
3. `npm start`
